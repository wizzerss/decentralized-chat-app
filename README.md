## Introduction

Decentralized chat applications leverage blockchain technology to provide secure and censorship-resistant communication channels. This project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of decentralized applications (dApps) by implementing a chat system where user messages are stored on the blockchain.

## Features

- **Decentralized Messaging:** Messages are stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.
- **User Authentication:** Users can log in using their MetaMask wallet.
- **Real-time Updates:** Messages are updated in real-time using Web3 technology.
- **Customizable Usernames:** Users can set their usernames when joining the chat.
